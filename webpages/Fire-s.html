				<h1>Important things to know about Fire Safety</h1>
				<h2 id="vision">Prevention</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; The best way to deal with a fire is to prevent it from happening in the first place. This involves being aware of potential fire hazards in your environment and taking steps to mitigate them. Simple measures like proper storage of flammable materials, regular maintenance of electrical systems, and safe disposal of cigarettes can significantly reduce the risk of fire.
 				</p>
				<h2 id="mission">Detection</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;Smoke detectors and fire alarms are crucial for alerting occupants to the presence of a fire. These devices can provide early warning, giving people more time to evacuate safely. It's important to ensure that smoke detectors are installed in key areas of your home or workplace and that they are regularly tested to ensure they are functioning properly.</p>

				<h2 id="history">Evacutaion</h2>
				<p>&emsp;&emsp; Knowing what to do in the event of a fire emergency can mean the difference between life and death. Every home and workplace should have a clear evacuation plan that outlines escape routes, designated meeting points, and procedures for assisting individuals with disabilities or special needs. Regularly practicing fire drills can help ensure that everyone knows what to do and where to go in the event of a fire.</p><br>
